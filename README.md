Linear Regression Model
This repository contains Python code implementing a Linear Regression model for predictive analysis. The code demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results using popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
Features

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, feature scaling, and data splitting for training and testing.
Model Implementation: Builds a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn.
Evaluation: Calculates metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score to assess model performance.
Visualization: Includes plots for data exploration and regression results.

Requirements

Python 3.x
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

Usage
